    <p>The iron, phosphorous, calcium, magnesium, and zinc in potatoes all help the body to build and maintain bone structure and strength.

        Iron and zinc play crucial roles in the production and maturation of collagen.

        Potatoes are a great source of vitamin B6. This plays a vital role in energy metabolism, by breaking down carbohydrates and proteins into glucose and amino acids. These smaller compounds are more easily utilized for energy within the body.
        Phosphorus and calcium are both important in bone structure, but it is essential to balanceTrusted Source the two minerals for proper bone mineralization. Too much phosphorus and too little calcium result in bone loss and contribute to osteoporosis.</p>

    <p>The potato’s fiber, potassium, vitamin C, and vitamin B6 content, coupled with its lack of cholesterol, all support heart health.
        Many researchers believe that the potato’s arrival in northern Europe spelled an end to famine there. (Corn, another American crop, played a similar but smaller role in southern Europe.) More than that, as the historian William H. McNeill has argued, the potato led to empire: “By feeding rapidly growing populations, [it] permitted a handful of European nations to assert dominion over most of the world between 1750 and 1950.” The potato, in other words, fueled the rise of the West.

        Equally important, the European and North American adoption of the potato set the template for modern agriculture—the so-called agro-industrial complex. Not only did the Columbian Exchange carry the potato across the Atlantic, it also brought the world’s first intensive fertilizer: Peruvian guano. And when potatoes fell to the attack of another import, the Colorado potato beetle, panicked farmers turned to the first artificial
        Potatoes contain significant amounts of fiber. Fiber helps lower the total amount of cholesterol in the blood, thereby decreasing the risk of heart disease.

        Research based on the NHANES has linkedTrusted Source a higher intake of potassium and a lower intake of sodium to a reduced risk of all-cause mortality and heart disease.</p>

    <p>Choline is an important and versatile nutrient that is present in potatoes. It helps withTrusted Source muscle movement, mood, learning, and memory.
        How healthful a potato is in the diet depends to some extent on what is added or how it is cooked. Oil, sour cream, and butter all add calories, but the plain potato itself is relatively low in calories.

        It also provides important nutrients, such as vitamin C, vitamin B6, and various minerals.

        A 100-gram (g) or 3.5- ounce serving is a little more than half of a medium size potato. This much white potato, baked with skin, containsTrusted Source:

        94 calories
        0.15 grams of fat
        0 grams of cholesterol
        21.08 grams of carbohydrate
        2.1 grams of dietary fiber
        2.10 grams of protein
        10 milligrams (mg) of calcium
        0.64 mg of iron
        27 mg of magnesium
        75 mg of phosphorus
        544 mg of potassium
        12.6 mg of vitamin C
        0.211 mg of vitamin B6
        38 micrograms (mcg) of folate
        Potatoes also provide niacin, choline, and zinc. Different varieties provide slightly different nutrients.

        Sodium: Whole, unprocessed potatoes contain very little sodium, only 10 mg per 100 g (3.5 ounces), or less than 1 percent of the suggested daily limit. However, this is not true of processed potato products, such as French fries and potato chips.

        Alpha-lipoic acid: Potatoes also contain a compound known as alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), which helps the body to convert glucose into energy.

        Some evidence suggestsTrusted Source that alpha-lipoic acid can help control blood glucose levels, improve vasodilation, protect against retinopathy in diabetic patients, and preserve brain and nerve tissue.

        Quercetin: Quercetin, a flavonoid found in potato skin, appears to haveTrusted Source an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect that protects the body’s cells from damage by free radicals.

        Flavonoids are a kind of phytonutrient, organic compounds that are believed to help protect against disease.

        Antioxidants: Potatoes contain vitamin C, which acts as an antioxidant. Antioxidants may help prevent cell damage and cancer and promote healthy digestion and cardiovascular functions.

        Fiber: The fiber in potatoes helps to maintain a healthy digestive system and circulation.</p>

    <p>Potatoes contain folate. Folate plays a role in DNA synthesis and repair, and so it prevents many types of cancer cells from forming due to mutations in the DNA.
        pesticide: a form of arsenic. Competition to produce ever-more-potent arsenic blends launched the modern pesticide industry. In the 1940s and 1950s, improved crops, high-intensity fertilizers and chemical pesticides created the Green Revolution, the explosion of agricultural productivity that transformed farms from Illinois to Indonesia—and set off a political argument about the food supply that grows more intense by the day.

        In 1853 an Alsatian sculptor named Andreas Friederich erected a statue of Sir Francis Drake in Offenburg, in southwest Germany. It portrayed the English explorer staring into the horizon in familiar visionary fashion. His right hand rested on the hilt of his sword. His left gripped a potato plant. “Sir Francis Drake,” the base proclaimed,
