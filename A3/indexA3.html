                <p>potato, (Solanum tuberosum), annual plant in the nightshade family (Solanaceae), grown for its starchy edible tubers. The potato is native to the Peruvian-Bolivian Andes and is one of the worldâ€™s main food crops. Potatoes are frequently served whole or mashed as a cooked vegetable and are also ground into potato flour, used in baking and as a thickener for sauces. The tubers are highly digestible and supply vitamin C, protein, thiamin, and niacin.</p>

                <p>In this article we are going to consider a stastical machine learning method known as a Decision Tree. Decision Trees (DTs) are a supervised learning technique that predict values of responses by learning decision rules derived from features. They can be used in both a regression and a classification context. For this reason they are sometimes also referred to as Classification And Regression Trees (CART).

                    DT/CART models are an example of a more general area of machine learning known as adaptive basis function models. These models learn the features directly from the data, rather than being prespecified, as in some other basis expansions. However, unlike linear regression, these models are not linear in the parameters and so we are only able to compute a locally optimal maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for the parameters[1].

                    DT/CART models work by partitioning the feature space into a number of simple rectangular regions, divided up by axis parallel splits. In order to obtain a prediction for a particular observation, the mean or mode of the training observations' responses, within the partition that the new observation belongs to, is used.</p>

                <p>Skin finish is becoming more important as consumers increasingly demand potatoes with clean, attractive skins, particularly when buying fresh or table stock potatoes. Tubers with surface infections such as black scurf, silver scurf, powdery scab or common scab are less attractive and also likely to have a reduced storage life.

                    Correct balanced nutrition of the will reduce the incidence of skin disorders and improve the skin finish. Calcium strengthens tuber skins providing better resistance to many diseases. Boron, magnesium and manganese can reduce levels of common scab. Zinc can minimise powdery scab. Sulphur may reduce both powdery and common scab infection.</p>
                <p>Potatoes are one of the most important sources of starch worldwide. Variety choice is very important and potatoes with greater than 13% starch content are required in countries such as Germany. The higher the starch content, the lower the waste.

                    Nitrogen
                    Nitrogen is an essential nutrient to fuel canopy growth, however in temperate climates, an excess supply of nitrogen at later stages of growth will keep the crop growing, delaying maturity and may reduce starch content, reducing processing potato crop quality.<p>
